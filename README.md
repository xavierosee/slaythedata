# Slay the Data

Back in 2020, Mega Crit Games, developer of popular roguelike deck-building game **Slay the Spire**, [released a dataset of 77 million runs](https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/jt5y1w/77_million_runs_an_sts_metrics_dump/).

This is my attempt of trying to build something with it, most specifically an end-to-end Data Engineering project.
